# A Game for Senior Patients
A Final Project for the course FFAR250 at Concordia University

## Intro
The project consists of creating an interactive game to engage dementia and Alzheimer's senior patients in CHSLDs with low autonomy. This first iteration consists of one simple game that combines interactivity, engaging visuals, motions and sounds. The concept was carefully thought out to necessitate minimal comprehension effort on the player and focus on keeping them engaged. The simple characteristics of the game enable senior patients to entertain themselves indefinitely while in the care of healthcare workers.
